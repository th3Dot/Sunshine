        message="A newer version of com.android.support:appcompat-v7 than 19.+ is available: 21.0.0-rc1"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Looks for old or obsolete Gradle library dependencies"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

        severity="Warning"
        message="The image ic_launcher.png varies significantly in its density-independent (dip) size across the various density versions: drawable-mdpi\ic_launcher.png: 144x144 dp (144x144 px), drawable-hdpi\ic_launcher.png: 96x96 dp (144x144 px), drawable-xhdpi\ic_launcher.png: 72x72 dp (144x144 px)"

        summary="Ensures that icons across densities provide roughly the same density-independent size"
        explanation="Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute to roughly the same density-independent pixel (`dip`) size. This catches errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.">

        summary="Finds icons that have identical bitmaps across various configuration parameters"
        explanation="If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as `drawable-hdpi` or `-v11`, they should typically be different. This detector catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration folder which is usually not intentional.">
